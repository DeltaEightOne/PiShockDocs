## 3. Tips
### 3.1 Portable Operation
Using the PiShock while moving around in a space such as a Convention Floor requires nothing more then a Hotspot connection as well as a External powersource. 
#### **Power** 
Powering the PiShock is as simply connecting it to a Powersouce that can supply at least `5V/1A` like a Powerbank.
<br>
It is alternatively also possible to Power the PiShock via it's GPIO Pins using a LiPo (and optionally a battery hat) for an even more portable and compact solution.

#### **Network**
To Recive Commands from the Server the PiShock requires an active internet connection.<br>
This can be achived by using a hotspot from a Mobile phone (Note: it is advised to set this up before leaving for the Event to avoid issues with the PiShock loosing connection).
